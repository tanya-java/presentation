=== UNF

== 1NF

=== Rules for 1NF

[.step]
* It should only have single(atomic) valued attributes/columns
* Values stored in a column should be of the same domain
* All the columns in a table should have unique names
* And the order in which data is stored, does not matter

=== Example

== Primary Key

=== Attributes for Primary Key

* Primary key cannot be NULL
* Primary key value must be unique
* Primary key values cannot be changed
* The original key must be assigned a value when inserting a new entry

=== Composite Primary Key

== 2NF

=== Rules for 2NF

* It should be in the First Normal form
* It should not have Partial Dependency

=== Example

== Foreign Key

=== Attributes for Foreign Key

* A foreign key may have a different name from its primary key
* It ensures that rows in one table have corresponding rows in another
* Unlike the primary key, they do not have to be unique. Most often they are not
* Foreign keys may be null, although primary keys cannot

== Transitive Functional Dependencies

== 3NF

=== Rules for 3 NF

* It is in the Second Normal form
* It doesn't have Transitive Dependency
